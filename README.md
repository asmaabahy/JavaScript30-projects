# Day 1 : 28/04/2023 | JavaScript Drum Kit

In this project we made a very simple JavaScript Drum Kit really fun to play and when you hit the corresponding key on your keyboard, it's going to play the sound that's associated with that key. I learned about key events, as well as playing audio, as well listening for the 'transitionend' event.

# Day 2 : 30/04/2023 | JS and CSS Clock

We made a pretty sweet CSS clock. It takes in the current time from JavaScript and it updates the hands.

# Day 3 : 02/05/2023 | CSS Variables

in this project we've learned that CSS variables can be updated with JavaScript, meaning that when you update a variable in CSS, everywhere on the page that that variable is referenced will update itself. 
We've got three variables, spacing, blur, and base color. And when I change one of those, like spacing, it will just immediately update wherever that variable is changed on the page.
