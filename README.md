participating in the "30 Day Vanilla JS Coding" Challenge created by @wesbos 

# Day 1 | 28/04/2023 : JavaScript Drum Kit 

in this project we made a very simple JavaScript Drum Kit really fun to play and when you hit the
corresponding key on your keyboard, it's going to play the sound that's associated with that key.
i learned about key events, as well as playing audio, as well listening for the 'transitionend' event.
