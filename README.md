In this project we made a very simple JavaScript Drum Kit really fun to play and when you hit the corresponding key on your keyboard, it's going to play the sound that's associated with that key. I learned about key events, as well as playing audio, as well listening for the 'transitionend' event.

# Day 2 : 30/04/2023 | JS and CSS Clock

We made a pretty sweet CSS clock. It takes in the current time from JavaScript and it updates the hands.
